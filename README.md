# AnimalTrackers
The project involves creating a wearable device equipped with *GPS* functionality. This device continuously accesses *GPS* coordinates to determine the user's location. Using these coordinates, it identifies the nearest predefined *Point of Interest* (POI). If this *POI* is within 100 meters of the user, the wearable lights up with a color associated with the animal species typical to that area.

### Features
- The *Neopixel* lights up in the colors related to the animals;
- It allows to play the sound of the animal if the user is under 100 meters from the *POI* by pressing the button;
- If the user are not in the *Zone of Interest* (ZOI) the lights do not light up nor the *MP3* plays any sound;
- There is two ways to identify when the user enters and exits the *ZOI*, by lighting up or turning off the Neopixel with the color of the animal and by the number of times the muscle wire shrunks against the wearable. Twice when entering and once when exiting.
